## Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Items that address core functionality or security issues
- **High**: Features that significantly enhance agent capabilities
- **Medium**: Useful improvements that add value
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features for future consideration

## Implementation Timeline
- **Short-term** (1-3 months): Items 1, 11, 21, 31, 41
- **Medium-term** (3-6 months): Items 2-5, 12-15, 22-25, 32-35, 42-45
- **Long-term** (6+ months): Remaining items

## Notes
- This list should be reviewed and updated regularly
- New capabilities should be added as they are identified
- Completed items should be moved to a separate COMPLETED.md file
- Each implementation should include appropriate tests and documentation
